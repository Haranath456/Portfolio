Place your song files here.

To enable the music button in the site:

1. Add your MP3 file and name it `music.mp3` (path: `videos/music.mp3`).
2. If you want multiple songs, update the `audio#bgMusic` source in `index.html` and adjust `app.js` logic to switch tracks.
3. Ensure file is a valid MP3 (binary). Replace the placeholder `music.mp3` with the real file.

If you want me to add multiple tracks and a small UI for selecting them, tell me the filenames and I'll wire it up.
